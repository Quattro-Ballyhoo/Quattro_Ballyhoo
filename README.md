<b>Product Name and Description</b><br>
Based on user entered information from multiple data sources, including social media sites, open source sites and crowd source sites, the tool, Eye4Fish, will not only be able to generate reports for scientists who are tracking disruptions in fish ecosystems but also flag authorities regarding abnormalities in near real time. The tool will compare each user entered data point to a database consisting of information regarding fish species and their ecosystem requirements to find any abnormalities.

<b>Product Vision:</b><br>
For marine biologists, fisheries scientists, climate activists and other professionals who need a monitoring and alert system for detecting where fish species are living outside of their natural ecosystem, the Eye4Fish is a website that pulls information from multiple data sources in near real time and alerts the user and authorities to any anomalies in the data. Unlike Myfishcount.com, our product pulls recreational fishing data from multiple sources and informs the user in near real-time about potential problems in the environment.
